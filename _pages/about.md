My name is Zhang Xiangran, and I am currently a second-year graduate student in the Big Data Engineering and Technology program at Zhejiang University. I previously interned at HelloBikeâ€™s commercialization advertising department and am now working on traffic control in the video recommendation push department at ByteDance's TikTok. I have published two papers, with one currently under review. My research interests include recommendation systems and large models.

You can find my GitHub here: https://github.com/zxradrian.

Feel free to contact me via email: 22360301@zju.edu.cn or WeChat: Zhang-Adrian.
